                               <p>
                                   Hi, I'm Sabrina ‚Äî a software engineer with a passion for full stack web development and game development. I've always been drawn to technology, problem solving, and understanding how things work ‚Äî but my path here wasn't exactly straightforward.

                                   I started out as an engineering major in college, but like many women in tech, I felt intimidated by the lack of female representation in the field. I switched to Nutrition Dietetics, where I got to solve problems through food and explore complex biological pathways ‚Äî but something always felt... missing.

                                   The truth is, I never stopped loving tech. I'd tinker on my computer any chance I got. Even after trying out a few different career paths, I always ended up right back at my keyboard. Eventually, I took the leap to go back to school for Computer Science ‚Äî and I've known it was the right choice ever since.

                                   Now, every day I wake up excited to log onto my computer, clickity-clack away at my keyboard, and solve problems ‚Äî whether it's building seamless web apps or crafting immersive game worlds. What I love most about tech is that there's always something new to learn and endless ways to create.

                                   When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing video games, exploring the
                                   outdoors, or hunting down the perfect cup of coffee.

                                   I build because I love solving problems.
                                   I build because I love that feeling when everything finally clicks.
                                   I build because there's always something new to learn ‚Äî and I'm endlessly curious.
                                   Every project is a chance to learn something new, solve interesting problems, and build something that didn't exist before. That's what keeps me coming back.
